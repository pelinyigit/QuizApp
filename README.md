## Installation for Flutter

	To be able to open a Flutter project, you should be able to have some features and applications in your computer. 
	Learn how to install Flutter and it's features from here.

## Installation for Firebase

	To be able to use the Login feature in source code, you might want to add a Firebase project and link it to the source code. With that, you will be able to use the Authentication for your liking. The explanation is down the link. 

		https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup

## Versions 

	You can find all the extra informations for versions in the source code inside the pubspec.yaml.
  
		Version : 1.0.0+1

		sdk: ">=2.1.0 <3.0.0"

		http: ^0.12.0
 
		firebase_auth: ^0.11.0

		frideos: ^0.6.0

## How to use this code

	1) Open the zip file in the description. I prefer VScode to open the project but it's up to you. (Depending on which IDE you will use, you might need to install the language Dart in it.)  
		(If you want to download VScode go here: (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

	2) After you have successfully open the source code, you might want to check on the links that I put above for Flutter, Dart, Firebase dependencies, plugins and versions.

	3) Open the flutter link that I have put and install Android Studio to your computer to use an emulator. Follow the instructions in the link and you will be ready to open the project. 

	4) After installing every environment you need, you still might have some issues with packages, since I don't know when you will be using this source. Everything about Flutter changes so fast, so you might want to upgrade the versions that I have put above and add new dependencies.

	-To learn how to use packages : https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/using-packages

	-To update both the Flutter SDK and the packages that your app depends on, use the flutter upgrade command from the root of your app (the same directory that contains the pubspec.yaml file):

		"flutter upgrade"

	5) After you have finished all the version part, you can now run the code properly. 

	6) Open the terminal and write this command: 
		"flutter run"

	7) If it all works without a problem, than you are good to go with QuizApp. Have Fun.
